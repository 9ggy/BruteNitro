# BruteNitro
A brute force approach at sniping nitro codes. Host it on a cloud based server in order for it to run forever. 

## Credits
Credits have to be given to https://github.com/KanekiWeb/Nitro-Generator for writing the outline for this codebase/idea. Unfortunately, the code is flawed in alot of places; I wanted to rewrite it, so i did just that.

<h2>How to use</h2>

##### *the following tutorial will be how to run this locally, but you can apply the same ideas to running this in a cloud enviornment link Replit, Heroku, etc.*

 - clone the git repo: `git clone [link]` (or just copy the code into the respective file names)
 - replace *Your Webhook* with your discord webhook.
 - run: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
 - run: `python3 brutenitro.py`
 - wait for your stolen nitro, may take a while due to it being a brute force approach.
